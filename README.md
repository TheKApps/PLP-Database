# PLP-Database
A small database to store students names and contacts.
PLP Database is a small database tool built with Python and PyQt5.
It stores the names and contacts of students

This project was done to the fulfillment of the PowerLearn Project Scholarship.
This tool can be used to add students, update and delete students from the database. 
This tool demonstrates what I have learnt in the database programming class.

# Running the Application

To run the PLP Database tool, you need to download the source code. Then open a terminal or command-line window and run the following steps:

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.


2. Install the dependencies ie PyQt5==5.15.2


3. Run the application ie python3 plpdatabase.py


This application was coded and tested with Python 3 and PyQt 5.15.2.
